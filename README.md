# FANDOM WEBP-to-original redirector

Javascript userscript that allows one to automatically get redirected to a FANDOM (formerly Wikia)-hosted WEBP image's original extension. While WEBP is useful when by FANDOM displaying images on webpages, its lack of compatibility and potential quality loss makes it unsuitable for downloads when compared to more traditional formats like PNG and JPG.

This userscript can't redirect images at FANDOM's central site (https://www.fandom.com/), instead working only on its wikis.
## Usage/Examples

The userscript triggers when a FANDOM-hosted's image is opened. That way, browsing the URL https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/9/97/Harry_Potter.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20140603201724 redirects the user to https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/9/97/Harry_Potter.jpg?format=original.
